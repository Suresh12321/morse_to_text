# morse_to_text

Simple Morse <----------> Text converter coded in python with sound (SOUND FEATURE LIMITED TO WINDOWS ONLY)

Used the following libraries:-
  1) time (IN-BUILT)     :   Essentail in order to use the 'sleep' function to add between dots, dashes, morse elemnets and words
  2) winsound (WINDOWS ONLY) :   Imported to use the 'Beep' function to add the morse sound effect

Program is a series of if-else statments for each alphabet and morse tanslations.
In order to fast things up predefined function were used to mimic 'dot' and 'dash' behaviour
